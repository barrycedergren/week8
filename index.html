                    The fort was built by the United States Army and completed in 1819. It was a key training post for soldiers and recruits during the American Civil War.                    
                    The fort was also used and fought in during both the Indian Wars and the Spanish-American war. Fort Snelling played an essential role during WWII, where it was used as a Military Intelligence Service Language School to train army personnel in Japanese.

                    Split Rock Lighthouse was constructed in 1905 when a freak storm destroyed several boats, wrecked many ships, and crew members died. The lighthouse rises for 54 feet(16.46m) above its 130 ft(40m) cliff base. Following many years of active service, the authorities turned the lighthouse into a historical sight in 1982.
                    Today the lighthouse and surrounding area cover 80 acres of parkland and visitor centre, and the lighthouse is no longer currently in use.

                    Cass Gilbert designed the current building, with work beginning in 1896, and the Capitol opened in 1905. The building features the second largest self-supported marble dome in the world. 
                    Its interior is adorned with ornate artworks and murals dating back to the buildings inception in 1905. Visit the Capitol on a dry day to get a chance to visit the Quadriga, numerous golden horses pulling chariots that adorn the rooftop.
